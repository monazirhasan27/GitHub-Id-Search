<!--  The code starts with a tag which sets the encoding of the document to UTF-8.
 The next line is a meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0".
 This tells the browser that it should set its viewport width and scaling factor to be as wide as possible while still fitting on screen (the device).
 The title tag has an href attribute pointing to style.css which contains all of the styles for this page.
 The script src attribute points to script.js which contains all of the JavaScript code for this page.
 The code is a HTML document with an input field for searching Github users. -->
